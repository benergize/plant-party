# Plant Party

Greetings kids, welcome to the horror beyond imagination that is the source code for Plant Party. Just kidding my code is beautiful and my commit messages are deeply meaningful.

You can play the compiled latest version of Plant Party at https://benergize.itch.io/plant-party.

I made Plant Party for the Wilmington IO 2025 game jam. I am open sourcing this in case anyone wants to see how it was made or wants to contribute their own minigame, which would be cool.

# Dear god what is up with the commit messages?

...yeah... I was making this for a game jam and basically using source control as a form of emergency backup, not planning on ever sharing it with the world. Highlights from the commit history include:

- "asdf"
- "asdf"
- "asdf"
- and "asdf"

# How do I work on this?

You'll need a copy of Game Maker Studio 1.4. This is not a Game Maker Studio 2 project. Everything is done with GML, 

All the code lives in the MobileTest directory. Why is it called MobileTest? Again, game jam. Get off my case, you're not my dad.
